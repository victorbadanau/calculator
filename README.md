# Calculator app
This is a mini-project/assignment from The Odin Project Foundations Course.
The goal is to build a basic calculator which executes one operation
at a time. It can use the last operation result as the first number for the next operation.
I will try to implement the "extra credit" goals:
  - the user can enter a floating point number: done;
  - add a functional backspace button: done;
  - add keyboard support: done;
